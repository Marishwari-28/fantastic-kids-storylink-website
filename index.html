            <h1>Chutti Krishna</h1>
            <p>Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and Vasudeva and ordered his soldiers to guard the cell. Every time Devaki gave birth to a child, Kamsa would visit the couple and take 
                away their baby. Dashing it to the wall, he would kill it. When Devaki was pregnant for the seventh time, the foetus was miraculously transferred to Rohini’s 
                womb in Vrindavan. Kamsa was told  that it had been a stillbirth. Devaki and Vasudeva’s eighth child Krishna was born at the stroke of midnight. This special 
                day is now celebrated as Janmashtami.

            <h1>Krishna Loves For Butter</h1>
            <P>Krishna loved eating butter. As he grew older, Krishna started stealing butter from his own house and neighbours’. Yashoda hung up the butter so that Krishna wouldn’t
                 be able to reach it. Slowly, other gopis also followed suit.Krishna and his friends weren’t the ones to give up easily. They worked out a solution to this. The next 
                 time they raided a house for butter, Krishna made his friends form a human pyramid. He reached the top and broke the pot of butter. The friends relished it, much to 
                 the anger and disappointment of the gopis! </P>
